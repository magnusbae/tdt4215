This delivery consists of several main parts:

-Report       The report in PDF-format.
-Source code  The source code for the project including all dependencies and 
              necessary data
-Built code   Binary versions for Windows and OS X.

Please note that the system requires JRE 7 on the machine that is to be used
to run the binary versions, and JDK 7 to successfully compile and run the code
from source.

=======================

To run the built code on 

Windows:
java -jar nlhparser.jar

Mac:
java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar nlhparser.jar

or use the attached scripts (.bat and bash-scripts respectively). 


To build the source code you need all the required .jar-files in classpath 
(lib folder). 
The group has been using Eclipse throughout the project.
